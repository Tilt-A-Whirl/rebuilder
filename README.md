# rebuilder
Rebuilds one image using tiles from another image

This script takes a "memory" image and a "portrait" image as input (or whatever images you like) and outputs a new 
portrait rebuilt using blocks from the memory image. 

Type ./rebuild.py -h for usage.

This script was originally written in Python 2.5 on Mac OS X 10.6. Development is continuing under Python 2.7 on 
OS X Yosemite. To run, please make sure the PIL library is installed for your version. It can be found here:
